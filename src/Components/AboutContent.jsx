                <p>Buy, style, sell or trade. <i>The Hills</i> is an online space we've created for you who want to be a part of something new and different.

                    <h1>Our Story</h1>
                    <p>This page is created by Hyper Island students in the Frontend Developer class of 2023.
                        Our task was to build an e-commerse using both frontend and backend.
                        But we wanted to expand on that.</p>
                    <p>This is an e-commerce that's a little bit different from what you've seen before.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Buying an apartment</h1>
                    <p>You purchase a self-selected amount of coins in our marketplace to be able to get started.
                        After that you can purchase, sell and trade apartments on this website.
                        Different apartments come with different prices, depending on how the apartment looks,
                        where in the building the apartment is located and what type of furnishings and style options you can add on to it.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Customizing your apartment</h1>
                    <p>You customize your apartment by buying furnishings, decor and style options in the marketplace.
                        Depending on which apartment you bought you will have different options on what to select from on the marketplace.

                        <p>In your apartment view you will gain access to a repository- which is where all your bought items will be collected.
                            You use the repository to put the things you want in to the apartment view.
                        </p>

                    <h1>An exclusive experience</h1>
                    <p>The apartment you buy in The Hills' building will be unique to you and the purpose is for you to personalize it as much as possible
                        to really make it stick out. Other people can visit your apartment and you can sell it and trade it between other users if you want.
                        This is an exclusive experience- for when all apartments in the building are sold out, people from the outside world have to wait
                        for an active user to sell their apartment to finally gain access.
