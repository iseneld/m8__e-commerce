            <h1>Customizing your apartment</h1>
            <p>You customize your apartment by buying furnishings, decor and style options in the marketplace.
                Depending on which apartment you bought you will have different options on what to select from on the marketplace.</p>
            <p>In your apartment view you will gain access to a repository- which is where all your bought items will be collected.
                You use the repository to put the things you want in to the apartment view.</p>
