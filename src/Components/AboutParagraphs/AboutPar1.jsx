            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>This page is created by Hyper Island students in the Frontend Developer class of 2023.
                Our task was to build an e-commerse using both frontend and backend.
                But we wanted to expand on that.</p>
            <p>This is an e-commerce that's a little bit different from what you've seen before.
