            <h1>An exclusive experience</h1>
            <p>The apartment you buy in The Hills' building will be unique to you and the purpose is for you to personalize it as much as possible
                to really make it stick out. Other people can visit your apartment and you can sell it and trade it between other users if you want.
                This is an exclusive experience- for when all apartments in the building are sold out, people from the outside world have to wait
                for an active user to sell their apartment to finally gain access.
            </p>
